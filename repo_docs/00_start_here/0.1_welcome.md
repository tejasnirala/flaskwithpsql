# 👋 Welcome to Flask with PostgreSQL

> **Your Complete Learning Journey from Node.js to Flask**

## 🎯 What This Documentation Is

This is not just API reference documentation. This is a **learning guide** designed specifically for developers coming from a **Node.js/Express background** who want to deeply understand Flask and Python backend development.

Every file, every line of code, every configuration choice is explained with:

-   **What** it does
-   **Why** it exists
-   **How** it works internally
-   **Comparisons** to Node.js equivalents where helpful

## 🏆 Goals of This Documentation

By the time you finish reading these docs, you will:

1. ✅ **Understand Python** - Syntax, patterns, and conventions
2. ✅ **Master Flask** - App factory, blueprints, extensions
3. ✅ **Know SQLAlchemy** - ORM, models, queries, migrations
4. ✅ **Build APIs** - RESTful design, validation, responses
5. ✅ **Implement Auth** - JWT, security, rate limiting
6. ✅ **Apply Patterns** - Service layer, clean architecture
7. ✅ **Use DevOps** - Docker, CI/CD, testing
