# 9.4 Glossary

> **Terms and Definitions**

This reference document defines common terms used throughout the project and documentation.

---

## A

### API (Application Programming Interface)

A set of rules and protocols that allow software applications to communicate with each other. In this project, we build a REST API that clients can call over HTTP.

### Application Context

Flask's context that holds application-level data. Required for accessing `current_app`, database operations, and other Flask features.

### Application Factory

A function that creates and configures a Flask application instance. Our `create_app()` function is an application factory.

```python
def create_app(config_name="development"):
    app = Flask(__name__)
    # ... configure app
    return app
```

---

## B

### Bearer Token

A type of access token sent in the HTTP `Authorization` header. Format: `Authorization: Bearer <token>`

### Blueprint

Flask's way of organizing routes and views into modular components. Like Express Router in Node.js.

```python
users_bp = APIBlueprint("users", __name__)
```

### Branch Coverage

A test coverage metric that measures which branches (if/else paths) have been executed by tests.

---

## C

### CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment)

Practice of automatically building, testing, and deploying code changes. We use GitHub Actions for CI/CD.

### Clean Architecture

An architectural pattern that separates concerns into layers (routes → services → models), making code more maintainable and testable.

### Commit Message (Conventional)

A standardized commit message format: `type(scope): description`

-   `feat:` - New feature
-   `fix:` - Bug fix
-   `docs:` - Documentation

### Container

A lightweight, portable environment that packages an application with its dependencies. Docker creates containers.

A security mechanism that controls which domains can access your API.

### CRUD

Acronym for Create, Read, Update, Delete - the basic operations for data management.

---

## D

### Decorator

A Python feature that wraps a function to add behavior. Like `@` annotations.

```python
@jwt_required()  # Decorator
def protected_route():
    pass
```

### Dependency Injection

A design pattern where dependencies are passed to a component rather than created inside it. Makes code more testable.

### Docker

A platform for building and running applications in containers.

### Docker Compose

A tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications using a YAML file.

### Dockerfile

## E

### Endpoint

A specific URL path in an API that handles particular requests. Example: `/api/v1/users`

### Environment Variable

A variable set outside the application code that configures its behavior. Example: `DATABASE_URL`

### E2E (End-to-End) Test

A test that exercises the entire application stack, from HTTP request to database.

---

## F

### Factory Pattern

A design pattern that uses a function to create objects. `create_app()` is a factory function.

A database column that references the primary key of another table.

---

## G

### Gunicorn

A Python WSGI HTTP Server for production deployments. Runs Flask apps with multiple workers.

### Git

A version control system for tracking code changes.

### GitHub Actions

GitHub's CI/CD platform for automating workflows.

---

## H

### Hash (Password)

A one-way cryptographic function that converts a password into a fixed-length string. Cannot be reversed.

### Health Check

An endpoint that reports if the application is running correctly. Usually `/health`.

### HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)

The protocol used for communication between clients and servers on the web.

### HTTP Methods

Actions that can be performed on resources: GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE.

---

## I

### Image (Docker)

A read-only template containing instructions for creating a Docker container. Built from a Dockerfile.

### Integration Test

A test that verifies multiple components working together, usually with a real database.

---

## J

### JWT (JSON Web Token)

A compact, URL-safe token format used for authentication. Contains claims (user info) and is cryptographically signed.

### JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)

A lightweight data format used for API requests and responses.

---

## L

### Linter

A tool that analyzes code for potential errors and style issues. We use flake8.

### Logger

A Python module for recording events during program execution.

---

## M

### Middleware

Code that runs between receiving a request and sending a response. Flask uses before/after request handlers.

### Migration

A way to evolve your database schema over time. Created with `flask db migrate`.

### Model (ORM)

A Python class that represents a database table. Each instance is a row.

```python
class User(db.Model):
    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
```

### Multi-Stage Build (Docker)

A Dockerfile technique that uses multiple `FROM` statements to create smaller, more secure images.

---

## N

### Nginx

A web server often used as a reverse proxy in production deployments.

---

## O

### ORM (Object-Relational Mapping)

A technique that converts between database tables and Python objects. SQLAlchemy is our ORM.

### OpenAPI

---

## P

### Primary Key

A unique identifier for each row in a database table. Usually an auto-incrementing integer.

### Pydantic

    username: str
    email: EmailStr
    password: str
```

### pytest

---

## R

A security model where permissions are assigned to roles, and roles to users.

### Rate Limiting

Restricting the number of requests a client can make in a time period.

### Token

A string that represents authentication information. Can be JWT, refresh token, etc.

### Transaction

A set of database operations that succeed or fail as a unit.

### Type Hints
